# 30 By Ninety Theatre — Build Governance
## 30BN_PROCESS_v1.md — v1.4
### Created: July 2026 | Last Updated: July 2026 — v1.4 (Phase 4 complete)

This document governs how every build session is run. It exists alongside the Brief as a required read at the start of every Claude Code session. These rules are not suggestions — they are the standards that keep builds clean, efficient, and error-free.

Conventions inherited and adapted from the Witching Hour build (TWH_PROCESS_v1.md), which itself inherited from Wizard Mansion. Rules here are either directly ported from TWH or are 30BN-specific preventive measures.

---

## 1. Session Starter Block

Every Claude Code prompt must open with this block verbatim.
No exceptions. Do not begin any build work until both files are confirmed read.

```
Before writing any code or SQL, read these two files in full
and confirm you have read them before proceeding:
1. 30BN_BRIEF_v1.md — the complete authoritative record of the
   tech stack, brand system, database schema, feature set, and
   all confirmed design decisions for the 30 By Ninety Theatre
   Volunteer Platform.
2. 30BN_PROCESS_v1.md — the build governance rules you must
   follow throughout this session.
Once you have read both, confirm you are ready and I will
provide the build prompt.
```

**CRITICAL:** Always use the exact versioned filenames. If you cannot find the versioned file, stop and flag it — never fall back to an unversioned file.

This single step prevents the majority of "built something that doesn't match the spec" errors.

---

## 2. Schema Verification Rule

Before writing any SQL or any server action that touches a database table, verify the actual live schema first. **Never assume column names from memory or from a previous session.**

**Required query before touching any table:**

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

Run this for every table a prompt will touch. Confirm results match the 30BN_BRIEF_v1.md §9 schema before writing any code that references those columns.

**This rule is non-negotiable.** Inherited from confirmed TWH and Wizard Mansion failures caused by schema assumptions.

---

## 3. Scope Lock

Every prompt has a defined scope. Do not build anything outside that scope, even if it seems obviously related or helpful.

If during a build you notice something adjacent that needs doing, record it as a Q-item in the post-build summary. Do not build it. Do not "just fix it while you're here."

**Why:** Scope creep is the primary source of unexpected breakage. TWH had multiple incidents where "just fixing it" introduced regressions in untouched features.

**Follow-up Q pattern:** At the end of every build, list outstanding items as:
```
Q1. [Question or item noticed but not acted on]
Q2. [Another item]
```
These carry forward to the next prompt.

**Prompt size evaluation:** Before writing any build prompt, count how many of these it touches: {migration, server action, page, modal/component}. If more than one, evaluate splitting into sub-prompts (e.g., 30BN-3.2a/b pattern). The goal is one clear deliverable per prompt, fully verified before the next begins.

**ADMIN-prefixed prompts:** `30BN-ADMIN.[N]` prompts are for standalone admin or infrastructure features that don't belong to a specific phase sequence. May be executed at any point. Follow all the same standards. Numbering increments from 1.

**Document update prompts** use the prefix `30BN-DOC.[N]` to distinguish them from feature/infrastructure ADMIN prompts. Exception: the Phase 1 completion document updates were labeled `30BN-ADMIN.0a` (Brief) and `30BN-ADMIN.0b` (Process) before this convention was established. All future document-only updates use `30BN-DOC`.

---

## 4. Migration Discipline

### Naming Convention
Migrations are numbered sequentially: `001`, `002`, `003`, etc.
Filename format: `{number}_{descriptive_snake_case}.sql`
Examples: `001_core_schema.sql`, `002_callboard_tokens.sql`

### Migration Rules
- One migration per logical unit of change
- Applied via Supabase MCP or Supabase dashboard SQL editor — this is the canonical workflow
- Every migration that creates a table with FK columns MUST add explicit indexes on those FK columns
- PostgreSQL does NOT automatically index FK columns
- Composite index column order: most selective / most-filtered column first
- Every migration is recorded in the Brief when it ships (add to schema section or note under relevant prompt)

---

## 5. Phase A / Phase B Structure (Debugging)

Any prompt that involves debugging, investigating unexpected behavior, or fixing something that "should work but doesn't" MUST use Phase A / Phase B structure.

**Phase A (Investigation — read-only):**
- Verify live state, not intended state
- Run actual queries against the live database
- Check `pg_policies`, `information_schema`, actual row counts
- Check deployed Vercel behavior (may lag commits by 1–2 minutes)
- Do NOT write any fixes in Phase A
- Report findings and wait for authorization to proceed

**Phase B (Targeted fix):**
- Only after Phase A findings are confirmed
- Addresses the root cause identified in Phase A
- Does not address anything else

**Why:** A fix based on assumed state rather than live state can create new failures. Phase A must verify against what is actually live.

---

## 6. RLS Pre-Prompt Verification

Before writing any prompt that touches Row Level Security, query `pg_policies` first:

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'your_table_name';
```

This is mandatory because:
- Missing UPDATE policies cause 503 errors in Server Actions that write then read
- Missing INSERT policies cause silent failures
- RLS must cover all operations your code performs (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

**Critical RLS rule for this project:**
`volunteer_notes` must have SELECT restricted to admin users only. The public-facing routes, the Call Board session, and any anonymous context must never be able to query this table. Verify this policy is in place before any prompt that touches volunteer profiles or Call Board pages.

---

## 7. Supabase Client Rules

Two Supabase clients exist in this project. Use the correct one for the context.

**`lib/supabase/server.ts` — `getServerClient()`**
- Uses `cookies()` — for Server Components and Server Actions
- Runs with the requesting user's session and RLS context
- Use for all data fetching in Server Components
- Use for all Server Actions that need user session context

**`lib/supabase/admin.ts` — `getAdminClient()`**
- Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — bypasses RLS entirely
- Server-only. Never import in Client Components.
- Use for: Super Admin account creation, sending admin welcome emails, any operation that must bypass RLS (e.g., looking up a volunteer by token without a user session), and public Server Component reads where no user session exists (e.g., fetching active opportunities or shows for a public page — server-side only, key never exposed to client)
- **Never expose to client side.** If you find yourself importing `admin.ts` in a `'use client'` file, stop — this is a security failure.

**Never create a client inside a loop.** Create once per function, reuse.

---

## 8. Build Report Format

Every completed build prompt must end with a build report in this format:

```
## Build Report — [Prompt ID]

### Completed
- [What was built, specific and concrete]
- [Another item]

### Verified
- [What was tested and confirmed working]
- [Test method used]

### Migrations Applied
- [Migration filename and number, or "None"]

### Files Created / Modified
- [File path] — [what it does]

### Q-Items (carry to next prompt)
Q1. [Item noticed but not acted on]
Q2. [Another item, or "None"]

### Flags
F1. [Anything that needs attention before shipping, or "None"]
```

**Build report timing:** The build report is delivered at the conclusion of the build session — after code is pushed and the deploy is triggered — without waiting for manual verification steps. Manual verification items (owner-performed per R16) are listed in the Verified section as:
`⏳ Pending owner verification — [step reference]`
The owner performs and reports manual verification after receiving the build report. The prompt is not marked complete until the owner confirms all manual items pass. If any manual item fails, treat the failure as a Phase A/B debugging session per §5.

If a build is incomplete or something didn't work as expected, that goes in Flags. Never mark something as Verified if it wasn't actually tested.

**Step Tracker Convention (required from v1.3 onward):**
Every build prompt must declare a step tracker block after the SCOPE section. The tracker lists all planned steps at the start of the session. Claude Code updates it in place as work proceeds — marking each step ✓ (complete) or ✗ (blocked) when done.

Format:
```
Step tracker:
✓ Step 1: [completed]
☐ Step 2: [in progress]
☐ Step 3: [pending]
☐ Step 4: [pending]
```

**The tracker is a single persistent element.** It must not be re-emitted or repeated after individual steps — doing so produces multiple copies that obscure build progress rather than clarifying it. Claude Code manages live-update behavior natively when given an initial declaration. Prompts must not include the instruction to "re-emit the tracker after each step." See R27.

---

## 9. Quality Gates

Every prompt has a Quality Gate defined in 30BN_BRIEF_v1.md §10. Before marking a prompt complete:

1. Every item in the Quality Gate must be manually verified — not assumed
2. If any Quality Gate item fails, the prompt is not complete
3. Do not move to the next prompt until the current prompt's Quality Gate passes
4. If a fix is needed, treat it as a Phase A/B debugging session

---

## 10. Grep / Search Verification

Before marking a prompt complete, run a search to verify no unintended patterns exist:

```bash
# Check for hardcoded category names (R4)
grep -r "Ushers\|Band Members\|Concessions\|Backstage" app/ components/ lib/

# Check for service role key in client files (R10)
grep -r "SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" components/ app/

# Check for tailwind.config.ts (R7)
ls tailwind.config.ts 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS - REMOVE IT"

# Check for router.push after mutations (R12)
grep -r "router.push" app/crew/
```

```bash
# Check for shadcn default semantic color classes left in components (R15)
grep -r "bg-primary\|text-foreground\|border-input\|text-muted-foreground\|ring-ring\|bg-secondary\|bg-destructive\|bg-muted\|bg-accent\|bg-card" app/ components/
```

```bash
# Confirm no dark: classes on public routes (ADMIN.6)
grep -r "dark:" app/ --include="*.tsx" | \
  grep -v "/crew/"
# (Should return no results — dark mode is admin-only)

# Confirm migration files are at repo root (R21)
ls *.sql 2>/dev/null
# (Migration files must be here, not in supabase/migrations/)

# Confirm no Button component in files needing brand hover behavior (R19)
grep -r "from.*components/ui/button" \
  components/crew/
# (Review any hits — confirm none need brand hover states that would be blocked by tailwind-merge)
```

```bash
# Confirm no formatCT() on bare date-only columns (R23)
# Safe: timestamptz columns (created_at, updated_at,
#   claimed_at, last_login, submitted_at, etc.)
# Fix needed: date columns (show_date, start_date,
#   end_date) or constructed strings (date + 'T' + time)
grep -rn "formatCT(" app/ components/ \
  --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
# Review hits — any call on a bare date column or
# constructed date+time string must use
# formatWallClockCT() instead
```

```bash
# Confirm no volunteer_roles queries use show_id (R26)
# show_id was removed from volunteer_roles in
# Migration 006 — all queries must join through
# show_dates instead
grep -rn "volunteer_roles" app/ components/ lib/ \
  --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep "show_id"
# Must return zero results
```

Add project-specific checks as new standing rules emerge.

## 11. Post-Build Checklist

Run before every Vercel deployment:

```
□ All five env vars set in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
□ NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL set to correct URL for this environment
□ No SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY referenced in any client component
□ Vercel framework preset confirmed as Next.js — Settings → General (not "Other")
□ After any shadcn init or add: confirm no tailwind.config.ts or tailwind.config.js was created — delete immediately if found
□ All Quality Gates for this prompt passed
□ Build report written
□ Q-items noted
□ Brief updated if schema or decisions changed (batch with owner approval)
□ Step tracker declared at session start — single persistent tracker, not re-emitted after individual steps (R27)
□ Any new date display: confirm formatWallClockCT() used for bare date columns (show_date, start_date, end_date), formatCT() for timestamptz columns (created_at, updated_at, claimed_at, etc.) (R23)
□ Any code touching volunteer_roles: confirm query joins through show_dates — no direct show_id reference (column removed in Migration 006) (R26)
□ All new /crew/* pages placed under app/crew/(app)/ — not app/crew/ directly (R20)
□ Any new shadcn component installed: check globals.css for var() injection (R17), check for tailwind.config.ts (R7), rebrand all semantic color classes (R15)
□ Migration files created at repo root, not in supabase/migrations/ (R21)
□ No Button component imported in files requiring brand hover behavior (R19)
```

## 12. Document Update Protocol

The Brief (30BN_BRIEF_v1.md) and Process (30BN_PROCESS_v1.md) are living documents.

**Rules:**
- All document updates require owner approval before execution
- Updates are batched to maximize efficiency — do not update after every small change
- When a new standing rule is agreed upon, it goes in Brief §13 AND is noted here
- Document version increments (v1 → v1.1 → v1.2) happen at the end of each build phase
- Never edit a document mid-build-session without owner approval

**What triggers an update:**
- A new standing rule (R-number)
- A schema change (migration applied that differs from Brief §9)
- A feature decision that resolves an Open Decision (Brief §12)
- A phase completed (status tracking in Brief §10)
- Any confirmed deviation from the Brief

## 14. Process-Specific Standing Rules

Rules governing this build process itself, kept here rather than in Brief §13 because they concern session conduct and CLI tooling behavior rather than product/schema decisions. This is a deliberate deviation from the general §12 protocol ("new standing rule goes in Brief §13 AND is noted here") for these two rules specifically.

### R16 — No Browser Verification in Claude Code Sessions
Claude Code does not use browser automation tools (Claude in Chrome or any equivalent) for UI, flow, or auth verification. All such verification is performed manually by the owner, who reports results to Claude Code as pass/fail. Build prompts must express all verification steps as manual owner tasks — never as browser tool calls. Established during 30BN-1.3.

### R17 — shadcn Init: Revert var() Injection Into globals.css
The shadcn CLI (v4.12+) injects a var()-driven CSS custom property theme block into `globals.css` by default during `init`, and may repeat this on `npx shadcn@latest add` commands. This overwrites the R7-compliant `@theme` block and is incompatible with Tailwind v4. After any shadcn init or add, immediately inspect `globals.css` and revert any injected `var()` block. The canonical `@theme` block with static hex values must be restored exactly as specified in 30BN_BRIEF_v1.md §3 Critical Constraint. Known shadcn CLI behavior to guard against.

### R18 — Empty String Normalization (cross-reference)
Already in Brief §13. Referenced here for R-number continuity. See Brief §13 R18.

### R19 — Plain <button> (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R19. Referenced here for continuity. Core rule: never use the Button component in files requiring brand hover behavior due to tailwind-merge incompatibility with custom @theme color tokens.

### R20 — /crew/* Route Placement (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R20. Referenced here for continuity. All Production Crew pages under `app/crew/(app)/`. Login under `app/crew/(auth)/login/`.

### R21 — Migration Files at Repo Root (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R21. Referenced here for continuity. No `supabase/migrations/` directory.

### R22 — Vercel Deploy Verification Is Owner-Side
Documented in Brief §13 R22. Referenced here because it directly governs session conduct: Claude Code must not include "confirm Vercel deploy" as a step in its own build process or flag its absence in build reports. Owner confirms deploy independently.

### R23 — formatWallClockCT() for Date-Only Columns (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R23. Referenced here for R-number continuity. Core rule: use formatWallClockCT() for bare date column values and constructed date+time strings; use formatCT() only for full timestamptz values. See grep check in §10.

### R24 — Nested useFieldArray Requires Its Own Sub-Component (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R24. Referenced here for R-number continuity. Core rule: nested field arrays in react-hook-form must live in their own named component — not inline in a render loop over a parent field array.

### R25 — Public Submissions Use null admin_id in audit_log (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R25. Referenced here for R-number continuity. Core rule: logAction() accepts string | null as admin_id; pass null for public-facing actions with no admin session.

### R26 — Roles Belong to show_dates, Not shows (cross-reference)
Documented in Brief §13 R26. Referenced here for R-number continuity. Core rule: volunteer_roles.show_date_id is the FK parent as of Migration 006. Any query for "all roles for a show" must join through show_dates. See grep check in §10.

### R27 — Step Tracker Is a Single Persistent Widget
The step tracker declared at the start of a build session is a single element updated in place as work proceeds. It must not be re-emitted or repeated after individual steps. Claude Code manages the live-update behavior natively when given an initial declaration. Prompts must not include the instruction to "re-emit the tracker after each step" — this causes multiple tracker copies to appear, obscuring rather than clarifying progress. The correct instruction is to declare the tracker once in the SCOPE section and allow Claude Code to update it. Established Phase 4 build session.

Note on placement: R27 governs session conduct (how the tracker widget behaves during a Claude Code session), not a product or schema decision. It lives here in §14 rather than Brief §13 for the same reason as R16 and R22. Brief §13 carries a cross-reference to this entry.
